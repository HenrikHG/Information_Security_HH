### Quintin 2014: 7 Things You Should Know About Tor
- **Purpose of Tor:** Tor (The Onion Router) is designed to provide anonymity and protect user privacy online.
- **How Tor Works:** It routes internet traffic through multiple encrypted layers across a network of volunteer-operated nodes, making it very difficult to trace the origin of the traffic.
- **Advantages:** Offers access to blocked or censored content, enables anonymous browsing, and protects against tracking.
- **Drawbacks:** It’s also exploited for illegal activities due to the high level of anonymity it provides.
- **Security Considerations:** Although Tor offers strong anonymity, vulnerabilities exist, and authorities actively research ways to de-anonymize users.

### Shavers & Bair 2016: "Hiding Behind the Keyboard: The Tor Browser"

#### Introduction & History
- The Tor Browser, a modified Firefox, was initially developed by the US government in 2002. It’s now open-source and maintained by privacy advocates.
- It's used for both legitimate purposes (privacy, accessing censored information) and illegal activities.

#### How The Onion Router Works
- Tor encrypts data in multiple layers and sends it through a series of nodes (entry, middle, and exit).
- Each node peels off one layer of encryption, ensuring that no single node knows both the origin and destination of the data, making tracking extremely difficult.

#### Tracking Criminals Using Tor
- While Tor is designed to maintain anonymity, law enforcement can use advanced techniques or exploit user errors to identify criminal activity.
- Investigating Tor users remains challenging, requiring significant expertise and resources.
