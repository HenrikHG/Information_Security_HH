## Summary of Schneier 2015: "Applied Cryptography: Chapter 1 - Foundations"

- **Introduction to Cryptography**: 
  - Cryptography is a method used to secure communication in the presence of adversaries.
  - It relies on mathematical algorithms to encode and decode information.
  
- **Cryptographic Systems**:
  - Cryptographic systems can be divided into two main categories: symmetric-key (private-key) and asymmetric-key (public-key).
  - **Symmetric-key Cryptography**:
    - Uses the same key for both encryption and decryption.
    - Fast and suitable for large amounts of data, but requires a secure way to share the key.
  - **Asymmetric-key Cryptography**:
    - Uses a pair of keys: a public key (for encryption) and a private key (for decryption).
    - Solves the key distribution problem but is slower compared to symmetric-key systems.

- **Cryptographic Algorithms**:
  - Cryptographic algorithms provide various functionalities, including encryption, decryption, and hashing.
  - Examples of cryptographic algorithms include DES (Data Encryption Standard), RSA (Rivest-Shamir-Adleman), and SHA (Secure Hash Algorithm).

- **Cryptanalysis**:
  - The science of breaking cryptographic codes.
  - Attackers use different techniques such as brute force, frequency analysis, and more advanced mathematical methods.

- **Foundational Concepts**:
  - **Confidentiality**: Ensuring that information is not accessible to unauthorized parties.
  - **Integrity**: Ensuring that the data has not been altered in an unauthorized way.
  - **Authentication**: Verifying the identity of the entities involved in communication.
  - **Non-repudiation**: Guaranteeing that a sender cannot deny sending the message.

- **Historical Perspective**:
  - Cryptography has evolved from simple techniques like the Caesar cipher to complex algorithms.
  - Modern cryptography involves computer algorithms and mathematical principles to create secure communication methods.

## Summary of Karvinen 2023: "PGP - Send Encrypted and Signed Message - gpg"

- **Overview of PGP (Pretty Good Privacy)**:
  - PGP is a tool that allows users to encrypt and sign messages using asymmetric key cryptography.
  - It uses public and private keys to secure messages.

- **Setup and Installation**:
  - Install `gpg` (GNU Privacy Guard) using a package manager (`sudo apt-get install gpg`).
  - Create a key pair (`gpg --gen-key`) with a name, email, and optionally a passphrase.

- **Generating and Using Key Pairs**:
  - A key pair consists of a public key (used for encryption) and a private key (used for decryption).
  - Public keys can be shared freely, while private keys must be kept secret.

- **Exporting and Sharing Public Keys**:
  - Public keys can be exported using `gpg --export --armor --output <filename>`.
  - The public key file can be shared with others to enable them to send encrypted messages.

- **Simulating Key Exchange**:
  - To send an encrypted message, both parties (e.g., Alice and Tero) must exchange their public keys.
  - Import the other party's public key using `gpg --import <filename>`.

- **Sending Encrypted and Signed Messages**:
  - Encrypt a message using the recipient's public key (`gpg --encrypt --recipient <email>`).
  - Sign the message with your private key to provide authenticity (`--sign` flag).
  - Use ASCII armor (`--armor`) for encoding, making it easier to share over text channels.

- **Decrypting and Verifying Messages**:
  - Decrypt messages using your private key (`gpg --decrypt <filename>`).
  - Verify the sender's signature using their public key, ensuring the message's authenticity.

- **Importance of Key Verification**:
  - Always verify the public key's fingerprint to ensure it belongs to the intended person.
  - This step is critical in establishing trust, as public keys can be shared over insecure channels.

- **Troubleshooting**:
  - Common issues include failed key generation and inability to find a public key.
  - Commands like `killall gpg-agent` can resolve certain errors by resetting background processes.
